Welcome to my little coding site!
========================

Here you will find documentation for some of the things I have coded.
Improvements and/or bug reports are encouraged.
Go ahead feel right at home, at the top is the main menu poining to each project, and on the right you will find the project specific sub-menus with links to the download pages, wikis etc. 

This website has been created with [Markdown To Static](/html/md2static/) a simple php script that converts markdown files to a complete website with menus and all.

Unless otherwise specified within the code, most everything you can find here is MIT licensed.
