GoTamer sbs
===========

sbs stands for Struct to Byte slice and back to Struct

sbs can encode a struct to a byte slice and back.

This is useful if you need to save data in a key value database for example, such as the leveldb, because the leveldb only takes bytes as values.

sbs encodes your struct first to a Gob, then it convers it to a byte slice, and it reverses the process for encoding.


#### Example
```
type Foo struct {
	A int
	B string
}

p := &Foo{111,"A string"}

byteslice, err := sbs.Enc(p)
...

foo := new(Foo)
structobject, err := sbs.Dec(foo, byteslice)
...
```
