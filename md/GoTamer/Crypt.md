GoTamer Crypt
=============

Is a light weight, very fast Data Encryption and Decryption package written in pure Go.  
This will not pass Bank or Spy cryptographic requirements in todays world but is good enough for most everything else.  
It is rune aware, it supports the full line of Go UTF-8 characters
