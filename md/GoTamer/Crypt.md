GoTamer Crypt
=============

GoTamer Crypt is a light weight, very fast Data Encryption and Decryption package written in pure Go.  
This will not pass Bank or Spy cryptographic requirements in todays world.  
I do not make claims about its security, please see the license file for details.  
*Advise: Please evaluate your needs and take additional measures to fit your needs. For example in my case I use multiple keys for each instance, and my application selects the keys randomly.* 

It is rune aware, it supports the full line of Go UTF-8 characters

A list of UTF-8 characters can be found [here][utf8]
