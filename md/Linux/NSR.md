Network Safety Restart Bash Script
==================================

If you ever work on a remote server/computer specialty on the network settings then this script may safe you from having to call support, and waiting on them.

When started/executed it

 * Sleeps first for 1 hour
 * Then it renames the ”/etc/network/interfaces” file by adding the current time stamp to the end of the file
 * It renames a file called ”/etc/network/interfaces.org” to ”/etc/network/interfaces”
 * And finally it restarts the server.

It also warns you a couple minutes before it does all that so you can terminate the program. Of course if you have been locked out you can't terminate it, and it will execute. Giving you a fresh start!
