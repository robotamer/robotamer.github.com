Markdown to Static Features
===========================

 * html and js, no server side scripts needed. Perfect for github and bidbucket hosting
 * Write in markdown, not html
 * Simple short php script
 * git history
 * git push and distribute to as many remote hosts you like
 * Automated git add, commit and push
 * Menus are autocratically created from files in each folder
 * You can have a sidebar file in each folder that gets added to the sidebar below the auto generated menu
 * We have a last modified date on each page. This date is extracted from git for each file in the md folder 
 * Blog like index.html file that lists all the headlines in last modified order. 

Roadmap
--------

 * Highlight code
 * Check git and only make and remake new and modified files
 * Create a folder just for news articles and add to new blog feature
